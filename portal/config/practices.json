            "info"   : "There has been a doctors surgery at 346 Grimshaw Lane for over a hundred years. The previous partners were Dr McHenry, Dr Wallace, Dr McKee and Dr McCrea. Dr Thomason replaced Dr McKee on his retirement in 1979 and Dr Martin started at the Practice in 1982. The Practice took over the surgery at Mount Road in the early 00’s and then moved up to the newly built Alkrington Health Centre in 2008. In 1979 the Practice of two partners had a patient list of 5500 people. It employed one morning receptionist and one evening receptionist, plus a cleaner.\\n\\nThe Junction and Alkrington Surgeries now have a patient list size of 8000+ people and employ 31 members of staff, plus several locum doctors. Our doctors, nurses, healthcare assistants, counsellors and receptionists all split their time between both sites (some work more at one than the other) whilst our admin staff are usually based at one location.",
