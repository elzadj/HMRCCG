Survey Creator wrapper
----------------------

v2.0 - 30 November 2014
----

- Built to support SC toolkit v2.0
- Wrapper now has total control of generated HTML. It only asks for raw data from the toolkit.
- Multi-language and media support, with 'id' attributes in YAML text elements.
- UI themes
- Defined images will be searched for in survey language folder, then survey folder then global surveys folder. Falls back to the literal path.
- Uses Composer for dependencies.
- Uses Grunt for preprossing and optimisation.
