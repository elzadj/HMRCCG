# Upgrading to v2.x

The toolkit has had a major rewrite. The YAML schema has changed slightly and many functions have been removed or replaced. For a start, all HTML-generating functions have been removed.

If upgrading to v2.x, do start afresh with the latest wrapper code. It is not worth retrofitting v2.x toolkit into an old wrapper.

Old survey YAML files can be manually upgraded, by taking the following into consideration:

## General

- YAML parsing is now in strict mode. This means arrays and objects cannot be mixed and some strings will need to be wrapped in quotes.
- All text values can be expanded into an object with 'id', 'content' and 'type' attributes.
- The 'content' attribute replaces 'title' for consistency, but 'title' will still work.
- The 'type' attribute can be set to 'plain' (default), 'markdown', 'markdown-block', or 'html'.


## questions.yaml

- The 'other' attribute must now be defined in question root.


## structure.yaml

- QuestionID elements can be expanded for text blocks. The 'type' will default to 'question' if not.
- 'text' and 'image' attributes must be replaced with a text object as described above.
- The 'intro' element is no longer supported. Use a normal text object instead.


## rules.yaml

- no changes
